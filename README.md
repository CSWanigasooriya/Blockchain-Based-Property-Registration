## Problem it Solves:
1.) Removal of middlemen./n
Removal of middlemen or brokers makes the process less expensive. Brokers trying to cheat uneducated 
people will no longer be able to do so. Brokers often take a long time to complete the procedures and so
our project will also save people time./n
2.) Distributed tamper proof ledger which prevents any fraud in ownership./n
3.) Secure storage of sensitive property registration documents using IPFS./n

## Technology Stack:
