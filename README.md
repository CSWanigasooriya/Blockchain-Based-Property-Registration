## Problem it Solves:
1.) Removal of middlemen.\
Removal of middlemen or brokers makes the process less expensive. Brokers trying to cheat uneducated
people will no longer be able to do so. Brokers often take a long time to complete the procedures and so
our project will also save people time.
2.) Distributed tamper proof ledger which prevents any fraud in ownership.\
3.) Secure storage of sensitive property registration documents using IPFS.

## Technology Stack:
1. Ethereum Blockchain
2. Polygon/Matic
3. Web3Dart
4. IPFS
5. Flutter
